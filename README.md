# The Literature Terms Anki
**Update 4: We are public and a-go!**
### (Also known as The Lit Anki)
This is a funny project EddietheEd and I are working on to build confidence with literary terms and concepts using the famed application for memorisation, Anki! This was originally made for Year 12 Literature ATAR students, but all students are welcome!

The text file named 'list.txt' within the data folder contains each term, along with the terms from the Literature ATAR Syllabus Glossary (found in SCSA's website [here](https://senior-secondary.scsa.wa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1020586/Literature-Y12-Syllabus-AC-ATAR-pdf.PDF)), as well as their definitions so you can view the terms from Github itself to know what you're in for. If you don't know how Anki works, simply download the file named "Literature Terms.apkg", click the Import file button in Anki and choose that same file.

The python uses AnkiConnect. You need to add this plugin and have Anki running in the background if you want to use the Anki-related python scripts. All the python scripts must also be executed while being in the 'python' directory.
