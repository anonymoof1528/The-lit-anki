Lit terms anki :)

**Update 3: We're back! #2024goals**

This is a funny project EddietheEd and I are working on to build confidence with literary terms and concepts (specifically for our year). The text file contains a term and its definition, then we copy it into the apkg file slowly.

The python uses AnkiConnect. You need to add this plugin and have Anki running in the background if you want to use the Anki-related python scripts.

Forgot to mention, but you have to execute all the python scripts while being in the 'python' directory.
